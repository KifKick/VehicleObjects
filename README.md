# Vehicle Objects - London Studios
**Vehicle Objects** is a **FiveM** resource coded in **C#** allowing you to add objects such as learner plates, pass plates and parking tickets/penalty charges to vehicles. This will be updated in the future with more objects, such as taxi signs and more!

The included models have been created by myself.

This plugin is made by **LondonStudios**, we have created a variety of releases including TaserFramework, SearchHandler, ActivateAlarm, SmartTester, SmartSounds, CustodyAlarm, SmartObservations and more!

## Usage
**/lplate** - Add learner plates to the nearest vehicle, or the one you are in.
**/pplate** - Add pass plates to the nearest vehicle, or the one you are in.
**/penaltycharge** - Add a parking ticket/penalty charge to the nearest vehicle, or the one you are in.

Simply run the command again to remove the relevant objects. This should work on most vehicles, however for the plates, only one may appear on some vehicles. There should be one at the front and back.
